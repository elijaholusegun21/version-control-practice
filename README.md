# Version Control Practice Project

This project is to demonstrate my understanding of Git and GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- Initialized a Git repository
- Created a new branch for feature development
- Made multiple commits on different branches
- Pushed commits to GitHub
- Opened and merged a Pull Request
- Reverted a commit using git revert
- Practiced pushing and pulling changes between local and remote repositories

---
